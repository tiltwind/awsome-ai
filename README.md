# Awsome AI

## LLM
- [OpenAI GPT4](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4),the latest milestone in OpenAI’s effort in scaling up deep learning. GPT-4 is a large multimodal model (accepting image and text inputs, emitting text outputs) that, while less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks.
- [LaMDA-Language Model for Dialogue Applications](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/), Google's LLM
- [LLaMA-Large Language Model Meta AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/), Meta's LLM
- [ERNIE-文心](https://wenxin.baidu.com/), 百度大模型
- [通义千问](https://tongyi.aliyun.com/), 阿里大模型
- 盘古AI, 华为大模型, 即将发布。

## Frameworks
- [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT), an experimental open-source application showcasing the capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. This program, driven by GPT-4, chains together LLM "thoughts", to autonomously achieve whatever goal you set. As one of the first examples of GPT-4 running fully autonomously, Auto-GPT pushes the boundaries of what is possible with AI.
- [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), inference code for LLaMA models.
- [Web LLM](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm), it brings large-language model and LLM-based chatbot to web browsers. Everything runs inside the browser with no server support and accelerated with WebGPU. 
- [MiniGPT-4](https://github.com/Vision-CAIR/MiniGPT-4), Enhancing Vision-language Understanding with Advanced Large Language Models
- [gpt4free](https://github.com/xtekky/gpt4free), decentralising the Ai Industry, free gpt-4/3.5 scripts through several reverse engineered api's ( poe.com, phind.com, chat.openai.com, phind.com, writesonic.com, sqlchat.ai, t3nsor.com, you.com etc...)
- [bark](https://github.com/suno-ai/bark), a transformer-based text-to-audio model created by Suno. Bark can generate highly realistic, multilingual speech as well as other audio - including music, background noise and simple sound effects. The model can also produce nonverbal communications like laughing, sighing and crying. 

## Chat
- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), chat based on OpenAI GPT.
- [Bard](https://bard.google.com/), chat based on Google LaMDA.
- [文心一言](https://yiyan.baidu.com/), 百度全新一代知识增强大语言模型，文心大模型家族的新成员，能够与人对话互动，回答问题，协助创作，高效便捷地帮助人们获取信息、知识和灵感。

## Program
- [Copliot](https://github.com/features/copilot/), GitHub Copilot uses the OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, right from your editor.
